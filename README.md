========


*TO-DO LIST!* 
--------------

- Add a MopBucket with WATER levels!.
- Add a tag to the player's NBT Structure to save the dirtiness level.
- Add a new Bar to display how dirty the player is.
- Add a listener to check type of block that the player is standing on to make different levels of dirtiness effect and how fast he his... (sweat).
- Add dirtiness punishments: A new poison effect which is NOT affected by milk, which is applied to the player if he is too dirty; randomly drop the player's items if he is too dirty; more?

**/// FOR THINKING PROCESS STILL**
- We need machines to process Lye's and hygienic products.
- We need world generation to spawn clays and special wierd plant's to be used on the Lye's and Hygienic things.

**// THERE ARE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE BEFORE THIS**
- Try to find a better recipe to Lye.
- Feature: if the player takes a bath, remove some dirtiness;
- Add water pipes, and basically an entire system so the player can take a bath and stuff like that... (god we're screwed) (yup... I ******* know.. but... SOOOOOO COOOOOL :P)
